# School_District_Analysis

## Overview
This analysis shows trends in school performance by looking at funding and standardized test scores. It will be used by the school board and superintendant to make decisions regarding budgets and priorities.

*** There is evidence of academic dishonesty from Thomas High School. 9th grade test scores have been removed from this analysis and excluded in calculating averages to uphold state testing standards. ***

This analysis analysis includes: 

- A high-level snapshot of the district's key metrics, presented in a table format
- An overview of the key metrics for each school, presented in a table format
- Tables presenting each of the following metrics:
  - Top 5 and bottom 5 performing schools, based on the overall passing rate
  - The average math score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - The average reading score received by students in each grade level at each school
  - School performance based on the budget per student
  - School performance based on the school size 
  - School performance based on the type of school

## Results
Below is how excluding the 9th grade data from Thomas High School effects the results for the entire district. Only test scores were excluded. No changes would be made to the total students or budget.
